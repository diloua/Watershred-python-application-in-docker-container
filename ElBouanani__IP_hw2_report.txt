Abstract :

I know I should not justify myslef like this. But I wanted to say that this homework has been done in extreme circumstances. My computer decided to give up its screen this past 2 weeks and I have been struggeling to get a replacement for it. But I did most of what I could even though its not satisfying.
This should not affect the grading but I just wanted to point that out first.

Questions :

II)

By using an 8 connected watershred more pixels are going to be considered connected compared than the 4 connected one, its going to reach more on the 8 connected one. Which means the watershred will be segmenting more on the 4 connected one, which is going to create more region,because pixels are seperated more often. 

III) 

Because of the limited ability of my computer I had to choose small images to compute. Because else it would crash. 
So I chose a first image where I applied a Gaussian filter, the original image has a dark side on top and bright on down. 
In the second image I applied a median filter to compare it with the first
In the third image I applied a simple thresholding of a bright value
